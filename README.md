In the Checkpoint 1 you can have some tools to scrape. <br />
In the Checkpoint 2 you have some KPI and links to them <br />
Otherwise there is a mockup of the dashboard <br />
And finally in "CONCLUSION DU PROJET STORKS.pdf" You can access to my analysis. <br />

# Tools
In the checkpoint 1, you have acces to two differents scrappers : <br />
Scraper.py is easier to use but you will scrap a bit <br />
Twintscrapper.py is more tough, you will need to modify some codes by some text editor like visual studio code. <br />
For exemple you can change the name of the file and the # (It's written in the code you will see it). <br />
But for our purpose It's useless, everything is already calibrate. <br />
By the way you can use some other tools like Octoparse and PowerAutomate (From Microsoft), these two tools are workflow. <br />
